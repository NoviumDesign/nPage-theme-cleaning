# Variables

## Structure of variables

The structure of variables is split into three parts: Framework-specific (nPage), Theme-specific (nPage-theme) and site-specific. The framework-specific variables such as base-colors, font-sizes, line-heights etc. Theme-specific contains variables such as variations of color (bright yellow, turqouise blue etc.) and site-specific variables are defining which of the framework- and theme-specific variables should be used.
